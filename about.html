    <div class="bio">
  I am a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at Addis Ababa University, with a strong passion for design, technology, and space exploration. 
  I am currently advancing my skills in front-end development and Data Structures & Algorithms through Nexus Tutorial. 
  Simultaneously, I am mastering SolidWorks with a focus on sheet metal design. 
  I am also actively participating in the AAKRUTI Design Challenge and the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC) campaign.
